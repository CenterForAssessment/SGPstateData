SGPstateData
============

State assessment program meta-data from large scale state assessments for use with SGP package
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SGPstateData is an environment (an object of class environment) containing information on state assessment programs, organized by state. Currently the list contains achievement level 
cutscores and labels for the state assessments, assessment name and abbreviation, growth cutscores and labels, information on vertical scaling, and knots and boundaries currently being 
used for SGP analyses at the state level. The cutscores, in particular, are used to calculate growth-to-standard/projection values. States currently included in the data set are 
Arizona (AZ), Arkansas (AR), California (CA), Colorado (CO), Connecticut (CT), Georgia (GA), Hawaii (HI), Idaho (ID), Illinois (IL), Indiana (IN), Kansas (KS), Maine (ME), 
Massachusetts (MA), Minnesota (MN), Mississippi (MS), Missouri (MO), Nevada (NV), New Hampshire (NH), New Jersey (NJ), New York (NY), Oregon (OR), Rhode Island (RI), 
South Dakota (SD), Utah (UT), Vermont (VT), Virginia (VA), Washington (WA), West Virginia (WV), Wisconsin (WI), Archdiocese of Baltimore (AOB),

**SGPstateData** is supported and maintained by two very nice people with the assistance of dozens of [state developers](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SGP/). We'd be happy
to add in your organization's data, answer questions and respond to feedback. Just make sure to show us some :heart:.
